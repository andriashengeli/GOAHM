                    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking 
                    a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form 
                    of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called 
                    football include association football known as soccer in Australia, Canada, 
                     Africa, the United States.

                    Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, 
                    opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of 
                    shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the 
                    defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) 
                    high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team 
                    from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made 
                    from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play 
                    stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two 
                    three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins,
                    but if regulation play expires with the score tied,
                    an additional period of play (overtime) is mandat
