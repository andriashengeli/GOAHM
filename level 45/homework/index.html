                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
                word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, 
                Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football;
                Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); 
                International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These
                various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".

                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different 
                parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these 
                games at English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The
                expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British
                influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes 
                were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional
                football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, 
                becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
                football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]
